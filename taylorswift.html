  <h1>TAYLOR SWIFT COMES BACK AFTER 3 YEAR HIATUS WITH DYNAMIC REPUTATION</h1>
<p> Taylor Swift has dropped her highly-awaited 6th studio album reputation. To support the release of her record she released 2 promotional tracks Look What You Made Me Do and Ready for It? as singles with music videos accompanying both of them. Together they've already accumulated over 600 million YouTube views and 400 million streams on Spotify before the album was even released.
</p>

<p>One of the standalone tracks on reputation is a record that I imagine came as a shock to her many fans. END GAME somehow manages to combine the styles of Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Future on one record in a way that makes all three artists shine individually as well as together.

The track, complimented by subtle hip-hop undertones, feels like modern day retelling of Romeo and Juliet. It describes 2 lovers with “big reputations” with “big enemies”, knowing that if they ever got together they would eventually turn into a “big conversation” and ultimately end, as the outside world would be too involved in their relationship. However, despite this knowledge Taylor still desires to be with this person. End Game perfectly demonstrates to her critics just how versatile Swift is as an artist and how she has the ability to make any genre of music work in her favour.</p>


<p>However an album is not complete without its disappointments. King of My Heart and So It Goes… sound very similar and sound like album fillers which isn’t always a bad thing. However, in this case not even the heavily generic and overproduction of the tracks could save them. Furthermore Gorgeous, despite its catchiness, is far too immature lyrically, lacks substance and is probably one of the weakest songs throughout Taylor’s whole discography.

The album lastly ends with sweet subtle love songs Call It What You Want and New Year’s Day which describe how Taylor is finally happy after a long time - “I make the same mistakes every time… at least i did one thing right” - and confident enough to not care about what the media thinks about her or her new love interest Joe Alwyn.


reputation brings together enough of the lyrical capability of RED but the attention-grabbing production of 1989 to create the most commercial, yet cohesive album Taylor Swift has ever released – pop or not. Despite a few disappointments, Taylor Swift manages to make an album that not only is controversial but is sure to be an enormous success selling over 700,000 copies in its first day, looking to compete with Adele and N*sync for highest debut sales. She validates her incredible talent, creativity and musicality with this record, making it an album that was worth the three-year wait.

Unfortunately, reputation is currently not on Spotify nor Apple Music, but you can download it from iTunes here.</p>
